# iOSUnityWebView

This tutorial explains how to extend my base plugin with an OpenWebView method, allowing an iOS WKWebView to be created, loaded, and then displayed and interacted with on top of Unity.

This tutorial creates a WKWebView and then adjusts its frame to allow for a blank space at the top of the layout, so some portion of the Unity screen is still visible and can be interacted with.
